    Basic interface running: connect to xmpp server, receive commands, send messages.
    Currently only 'help' command.
    The jabber id must be created by hand.

    I don't know really how, but when I try adding emma to my roster the bot automatically sends me a subscription request.
    I'm using ejabberd and psi.
