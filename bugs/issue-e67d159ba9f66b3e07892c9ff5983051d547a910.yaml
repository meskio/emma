    Basic interface running: connect to xmpp server, receive commands, send messages.
    Currently only 'help' command.
    The jabber id must be created by hand.

    I don't know really how, but when I try adding emma to my roster the bot automatically sends me a subscription request.
    I'm using ejabberd and psi.

    I think this bug is ready to be close.
    I fix a comple of simple things and the xmpp support I think is in a good shape,
    It will need more work in the future, but I start opening bugs for specific features.
