title: "Dynamic help: modules should provide help themselves"
desc: |-
  For example, irc_moderator itself should have a string (i18n-ed) with general instruction of module usage. Also, each of his commands should have also help.
  
  With the help information organized the help command could be more versatile, for example showing only commands on one interface, or providing verbose help for one concrete command.
