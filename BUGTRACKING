====================
Bug tracking in emma
====================

Emma uses `ditz <http://ditz.rubyforge.org>`_ to keep track of bugs,
features and TODOs.

Currently there is not much documentation, but `ditz's README
<http://ditz.rubyforge.org/README.txt>`_ is a good starting point.

Inline help can be used also:

    ditz help


---------
Why ditz?
---------

First of all: gitorious hasn't a integrated bug tracker, so we simply
plugged one :-)

We could have use `bugs everywhere <http://bugseverywhere.org/>`_, but it
seems a bit unnatural to have to create a bug and then remembering to add
some comment.

If you know another distributed bug tracker propose it as a new feature. We
are more like listening if also a migration patch is provided :-)


------
How-to
------

A quick way to start working with ditz.

First, execute the ditz command; it will ask you some basic questions. Fill
your name and mail, and when it asks about directory to store issues state
leave the default "bugs".


See all pending bugs::

    $ ditz

See all pending bugs assigned to you::

    $ ditz mine

Navigate the bug tracker::

    $ ditz html target

    And navigate to file://target/index.html

Add a bug::

    $ ditz add
    ... fill the questions...

    The command ends telling the created issue (something like emma-xxx).
    This is used in a lot of ditz commands, for example to commit the bug.

    $ ditz commit emma-xxx

    As pointed in the ditz add command output, you can also add the bug
    directly with git.

Search bugs::

    $ ditz grep regexp

Add a comment to a bug::

    $ ditz comment emma-xxx

Assign a bug to yourself::

    $ditz claim emma-xxx

Mark a bug as fixed::

    $ ditz close emma-xxx

Status of the project::

    $ ditz status


For more commands, see ``ditz help``
